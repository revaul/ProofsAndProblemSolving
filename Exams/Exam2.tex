\uplevel{Recall that horizontal motion can be represented by the equation \[m \frac{dv}{dt} = \overset{\rightarrow}{F} - \overset{\leftarrow}{F},\] where the overset arrows indicate the direction of the force. In addition, weight is equal to mass times acceleration, where acceleration is due to gravity.

\question[20] Jabba the Hutt's offspring, Billy the Hutt, received a hover board for May the Fourth Be With You Day.  The hover board is propelled \textbf{forward} by the Force with a force of 40 lbs.  Assuming that Billy is a lightweight at 640 lbs, and air \textbf{resistance} is two-thirds times its velocity ($\frac 23 v$), find how fast Billy is cruising after 30 seconds after starting from rest.  Assume that Tatooine has a gravitational force of~$g = 32$.  

\question[20] Jack Sparrow is readying the Black Pearl for battle, and is using a model for calculations.  He has realized the sails on the 20 lb model Pearl will propel the ship \textbf{forward} from rest with a force of $20v^{-2}$.  However, Jack has also calculated that the water \textbf{resistance} is proportional to ten times the velocity of the model ship ($10v$).  Find the equation yielding a function for velocity that Jack can use for the Pearl. \emph{Hint: This can be set up as a Bernoulli Problem, and acceleration due to gravity is $g = 32$.}
